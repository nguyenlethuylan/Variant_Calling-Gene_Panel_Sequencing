# Data Structure for Creating a Sample Sheet

A sample sheet organizes file names and paths to optimize inputs for automated workflows. It ensures tools can efficiently recognize and process data, improving accuracy and streamlining the workflow.

**The data may be located in different places; however, I will optimize the sample sheet creation for the two most common data formats**

## 1. Each sample's data is in a separate folder with the following structure.
Here is the data structure.

```bash
(base) lannguyen@lannguyen:~/Documents$ tree -L 2 data
data
├── sample1
│ ├── sample1_1.fastq.gz
│ └── sample1_2.fastq.gz
└── sample2
    ├── sample2_1.fastq.gz
    └── sample2_2.fastq.gz
```

This is the code block to create the sample sheet file. This code runs in R.

```r
input <- "/home/lannguyen/Documents/data" The path to the parent folder that contains the subfolders with data for each sample.
output <- "/home/lannguyen/Documents/data" The ouput path where to save sample sheet

# List subdirectories (one level deep) containing samples
sample_dirs <- list.dirs(input, full.names = TRUE, recursive = FALSE)

# Initialize an empty list to store sample information
samples <- list()

# Loop through each subdirectory to find fastq files
for (dir in sample_dirs) {
  # Check for files with either .fq.gz or .fastq.gz extensions
  read1 <- list.files(dir, pattern = "_1\\.(fastq|fq)\\.gz$", full.names = TRUE)
  read2 <- list.files(dir, pattern = "_2\\.(fastq|fq)\\.gz$", full.names = TRUE)
  
  # Ensure both read1 and read2 exist
  if (length(read1) > 0 && length(read2) > 0) {
    # Extract sample name from the directory name
    sample_name <- basename(dir)
    
    # Append to the samples list
    samples[[length(samples) + 1]] <- data.frame(
      sample = sample_name,
      read1 = read1,
      read2 = read2,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    )
  }
}
# Combine all sample information into a single data frame
sample_sheet <- do.call(rbind, samples)

# Print the sample sheet
print(sample_sheet)

# Write the sample sheet to a CSV file
write.csv(sample_sheet, paste0(output, "sample_sheet.csv"), row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

```

The sample sheet will have the following format: when read from the terminal, there will be three columns. Column 1 will contain the sample name, column 2 will contain the path to read1, and column 3 will contain the path to read2 of the data.

```bash
#(base) lannguyen@lannguyen:~/Documents$ cat data/sample_sheet.csv 

#sample,read1,read2
#sample1,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample1/sample1_1.fastq.gz,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample1/sample1_2.fastq.gz
#sample2,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample2/sample2_1.fastq.gz,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample2/sample2_2.fastq.gz
```

## 2.All data is located in the same folder.
Here is the data structure.

```bash
(base) lannguyen@lannguyen:~/Documents$ tree -L 2 data
data
├── sample1_1.fastq.gz
├── sample1_2.fastq.gz
├── sample2_1.fastq.gz
└── sample2_2.fastq.gz
```

This is the code block to create the sample sheet file. This code runs in R.

```r
input <- "/home/lannguyen/Documents/data"
output <- "/home/lannguyen/Documents/data"

# Get a list of all fastq files in the directory
fastq_files <- list.files(input, pattern = ".*(fastq.gz|fq.gz)$", full.names = TRUE)

# Initialize an empty list to store the rows for the sample sheet
sample_sheet <- list()

# Loop through each unique sample
samples <- unique(gsub("^(.*?)(_1|_2).*", "\\1", basename(fastq_files)))  # Extract sample names

for (sample in samples) {
  # Find the corresponding read1 and read2 files
  read1 <- grep(paste0(sample, "_1"), fastq_files, value = TRUE)
  read2 <- grep(paste0(sample, "_2"), fastq_files, value = TRUE)
  
  # Create file paths with the full directory
  read1_path <- file.path(input, basename(read1))
  read2_path <- file.path(input, basename(read2))
  
  # Add the row to the sample sheet
  sample_sheet <- append(sample_sheet, list(c(sample, read1_path, read2_path)))
}

# Convert the sample sheet list to a data frame
sample_sheet <- do.call(rbind, sample_sheet)
colnames(sample_sheet) <- c("sample", "read1", "read2")

# Write the sample sheet to a CSV file
write.csv(sample_sheet, file = paste0(output, "sample_sheet.csv"), row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

```

The format of the sample sheet file has not changed.

```bash
#(base) lannguyen@lannguyen:~/Documents$ cat data/sample_sheet.csv 

#sample,read1,read2
#sample1,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample1/sample1_1.fastq.gz,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample1/sample1_2.fastq.gz
#sample2,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample2/sample2_1.fastq.gz,/home/lannguyen/Documents/data/sample2/sample2_2.fastq.gz
```
